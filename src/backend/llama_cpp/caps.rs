//! What spellings *this* `llama-server` build accepts, asked of the build.
//!
//! Upstream removed `--mmap` / `--no-mmap` / `--mlock` / `-dio` in `14a9d09f7`
//! (2026-09-09) in favour of `-lm, --load-mode MODE`. Both spellings are in the
//! field at once: a host commonly has a current stock build beside older fork
//! builds pinned for a specific model, and a launch has to work on whichever it
//! resolves to.
//!
//! Version numbers cannot decide it — forks report their own strings
//! (`v1.5.2`, `b10715-mix`) and a wrapper script reports whatever it wraps — so
//! the probe reads `--help` and looks for the flag itself. Same shape as
//! [`super::list_devices::probe`]: one bounded subprocess per binary at boot,
//! and a binary that will not answer degrades to the older dialect rather than
//! failing the launch path.
